\subsection{Extendability of Nenwin}
The version of \textsc{Nenwin} present in this work can be seen as a specific subset of a more general computational scheme. This general scheme has a set of subclasses of particles (in the case of \textsc{Nenwin} there are two such subclasses, Marbles and Nodes), in which each particle has a \texttt{stiffness} and \texttt{attraction} parameter for each subclass in the architecture. Certain particles can 'eat' and/or 'emit' other particles of a specific class \footnote{One may object to allowing a particle to 'eat' its own subclass, it that it would have to eat itself. However, it is possible to make an exception for themselves, or to add another workaround (e.g. hollow absorption regions instead of sphere-shaped).}. One simple extension could be to introduce Nodes that can 'eat' and 'emit' other Nodes in a similar way to how MarbleEaterNodes and MarbleEmitterNodes eat and emit Marbles.

The specific subset of this generalized scheme is chosen as it was a small (but not proven to be \textit{the smallest}) subset of particle-subclasses that was provably able to simulate a CPU.
