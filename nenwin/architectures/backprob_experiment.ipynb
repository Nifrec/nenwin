    "Let's create a ring of Nodes, say 5 of them, and put one Marble in there. Not in the center, just somewhere within the circle of space (let's keep it 2D) enclosed by the ring of Nodes.\n",
    "Now let the loss simply be the distance of the Marble to the center of the circle *after 5 seconds from the start*.\n",
    "\n",
    "One likely result -- if everything works -- is that the Marble simply is placed stationary on this position. But that would already be some successfull optimization!"
