abstract = {Computer programmes have been developed for the simulation of atomic motion in liquids using the molecular dynamics method. The aims of this work are to study the relationship between the interparticle potential and liquid state properties and to produce data for the testing of theoretical models. Recent work has concentrated on increasing the number of particles to a few thousand and increasing the time step, in order to investigate the ‘hydrodynamic limit’.}

abstract = {Some multistep methods are presented that are particularly well suited for integrating the equations of motion describing the molecular dynamics of liquids and dense gases. Some tests and comparisons with other methods are described which demonstrate that a combination of a third-order explicit method for the calculation of positions and an implicit method for the calculation of velocities is particularly stable when used in computations of this type.}
