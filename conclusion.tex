This work explored the possibility of using particle simulation as a trainable machine learning agent.
A framework of particles, in particular Marbles and three types of Nodes, has been specified.
It was informally shown that this framework is Turing-Complete.
Theory has been devised for applying backpropagation and Adam (a variant of Gradient Descent) on the system.
This includes an optimizable, albeit highly nonconvex, loss function.
This theory has been implemented and several experiments have been conducted.
Evidence was found that the training can increase the performance of models with the backpropagation training,
but the framework appears to be very sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters.
Furthermore, proposals have been made for improving the time and memory performance of the simulation,
but these could not be tested empirically within the scope of this work.
