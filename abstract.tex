\begin{abstract}
This work describes an alternative modelling framework to neural networks, based on particle simulation. Theory is presented how the model can be optimized with backpropagation. An implementation and empirical results of optimizing a model are presented. Furthermore, we describe how the new algorithm could emulate a CPU, proving it is Turing-complete.
