\begin{abstract}
This work describes an alternative modelling framework to neural networks, based on particle simulation.
Theory is derived for optimizing models in this framework with backpropagation. 
An implementation and exploratory empirical results of optimizing a model are presented. 
Furthermore, it is proven that the framework it is Turing-complete, 
by showing informally how the new algorithm could emulate a CPU.
Finally, proposal are made how the simulation algorithm can be improved in memory and runtime efficiency.
