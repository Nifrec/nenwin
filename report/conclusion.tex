This work explored the possibility of using particle simulation as a trainable machine learning agent.
A framework of particles, in particular Marbles and three types of Nodes, has been specified.
It was informally shown that this framework is Turing-Complete.
Theory has been devised for applying backpropagation and Adam (a variant of Gradient Descent) on the system.
This includes an optimizable, albeit highly nonconvex, loss function.
This theory has been implemented and several experiments on a classification task have been conducted.
Evidence was found that the training can gradually increase the performance of models with the backpropagation-based training algorithm.
However, no good performing choice of hyperparameters have been found.
The best reached accuracy on the test set was 0.2174, while chance level is approximately 0.5.
Furthermore, proposals have been made for improving the time and memory performance of the simulation,
but these could not be tested empirically within the scope of this work.
